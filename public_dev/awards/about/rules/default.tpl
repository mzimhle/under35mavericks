                <p>The adjudication process is completely independent and is comprised of a panel of 7 judges who represent different areas of the business and entrepreneurship communities.</p>
                <p>The evaluation process runs through 5 different filtering stages, which ensure that all entries and information contained is checked and rechecked to remove human error and subjectivity.</p>
                <p><span class="txt-gold sub-intro-head uptxt">Stage 1:</span><br />Preliminary screening of the entry forms to shortlist and arrange them according to the respective award categories, this only happens once they have met all the minimum entry criterion and competition rules. </p>
                <p><span class="txt-gold sub-intro-head uptxt">Stage 2:</span><br />Compiled forms will be sent through to the judges for preliminary adjudication and assessment.</p>
                <p><span class="txt-gold sub-intro-head uptxt">Stage 3:</span><br />Post the preliminary assessment, 5 finalists will be chosen for each of the 10 categories and they will be required to do an online/ telephonic interview with our panel of judges.</p>
                <p><span class="txt-gold sub-intro-head uptxt">Stage 4:</span><br />Due diligence will then be done on each of the finalists, post this process the judges will then select a winner and runner ups for each of the categories.</p>
