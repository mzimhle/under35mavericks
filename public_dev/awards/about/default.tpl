                        <p class="text-left"><br />Going into their second year, The Maverick Awards for South African Youth Entrepreneurship Excellence presented by Under 35 Mavericks represent a point where South Africa stops to recognise, acknowledge and celebrate the impeccable youth entrepreneurial leadership in the country. The awards honour the genius displayed by young innovators, inventors and entrepreneurs who have launched start-ups that bring fresh ideas to life, drive economic growth, job creation and expand human welfare. The awards also demonstrate the economic contribution made by young entrepreneurs by showcasing their innovative and resourceful entrepreneurial achievements in a manner that inspires other young people to view and embrace entrepreneurship as a lucrative and rewarding economic activity.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">The Maverick Awards are positioned to elevate the profile and prestige of being a young entrepreneur in South Africa, while also empirically bringing both the public and private sector players to the realisation that the job creation and economic growth potential of South Africa, resides within our largely untapped youth entrepreneurial talent.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">The aura and spirit of The Maverick Awards for South African Youth Entrepreneurship Excellence is to celebrate the distinctly unique, independent and rare unconventional style of thought and action process, possessed only by a select few young people in any society who go on to attain phenomenal business success. These young entrepreneurs are prodigies of society that must be identified, preciously nurtured and capacitated to create lasting value that will continue to live and be enjoyed long after they are their time. The premise of The Maverick Awards is based upon the building and bequeathing of youth legacies to posterity.</p>
