<p class="text-left"><br />Hosted for the first time on the 26th of June 2014, to coincide with South African Notional Youth Month. The Maverick Awards represented the first time in the history of South Africa that a national award ceremony had been held to exclusively honour the excellence, efforts and contributions made by young entrepreneurs. Going into their second year, after being accredited as one of the official Global Entrepreneurship Week events for South Africa, The Maverick Awards will now be held in November annually to coincide with Global Entrepreneurship Week. Celebrated in 125 countries, Global Entrepreneurship Week is the largest global recognition and highlight of the contributions made by ntrepreneurs across the world - www.gew.co  IN addition to this The Maverick Awards have been endorsed by The Presidency of South Africa with Deputy Minister in The Presidency- Honourable Buti Manamela as patron of the awards.</p>

The Maverick Awards is a point where South Africa stops to recognise, acknowledge and celebrate the impeccable youth entrepreneurial leadership in the country. The awards honour the genius displayed by young innovators, inventors as well as job creators who have launched start-ups that bring fresh ideas to life, drive economic growth and expand human welfare through their entrepreneurship. The awards afford young entrepreneurs the opportunity to win prizes that are designed to accelerate the growth and impact of their enterprises from micro to small, small to medium and medium to large enterprises. The Maverick Awards are not just a recognition and networking affair, but rather a developmental vehicle used to identify and effectuate accelerated growth in young owned enterprises that display high growth - high impact potential such that they can speedily create the desired job creation and economic growth contributions needed by 
our economy- For 2015, prizes amount to a remarkable R3million worth of business 
growth and development initiatives for the finalists and winners.</p>

The Maverick Awards also endeavour to demonstrate the economic contribution made by young entrepreneurs, while showcasing their innovative and resourceful achievements in a manner that inspires other young people to view and embrace entrepreneurship as a lucrative and rewarding economic activity - In this regard and in celebration of Global Entrepreneurship Week, the awards gala dinner will be preceded by a week of exciting entrepreneurship activities led by the 2014 winners and 2015 finalists together with our partners/sponsors aimed at stimulating and inspiring entrepreneurialism among youths in the country.</p>

Lastly, The Maverick Awards provide a platform for connection, collaboration and empowerment, engaging all players along the entrepreneurship value chain in strengthening an entrepreneurial ecosystem that supports the development of young entrepreneurs in South Africa. The awards are positioned to bringing both the public and private sector players to the realisation that our job creation and economic prosperity potential exists within our untapped youth demographic such that going forward a more synergetic, strategic and unified approach towards youth entrepreneurship development can be employed.</p>
