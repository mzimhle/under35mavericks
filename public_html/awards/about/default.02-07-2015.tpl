<p class="text-left"><br />Hosted for the first time on Thursday 26th of June 2014, The Maverick Awards for South African 
Youth Entrepreneurship Excellence represented South Africa's first award ceremony held to 
honour the excellence of young entrepreneurs across the country.<br /><br />

Going into their second year, The Maverick Awards for South African Youth Entrepreneurship 
Excellence are now endorsed as a legacy project of The Presidency of the Republic South Africa with Deputy Minister in The Presidency Buti Manamela as the patron of the awards. The Maverick Awards represent a point where South Africa stops to recognise, acknowledge and celebrate the 
impeccable youth entrepreneurial leadership in the country. The awards honour the genius 
displayed by young innovators, inventors and entrepreneurs who have launched start-ups that 
bring fresh ideas to life, drive economic growth, job creation and expand human welfare. The 
awards also demonstrate the economic contribution made by young entrepreneurs by 
showcasing their innovative and resourceful entrepreneurial achievements in a manner that 
inspires other young people to view and embrace entrepreneurship as a lucrative and 
rewarding economic activity.</p>
<p class="text-left"><br />The Maverick Awards are positioned to elevate the profile and prestige of being a young 
entrepreneur in South Africa, while also empirically bringing both the public and private sector 
players to the realisation that the job creation and economic growth potential of South Africa, 
resides within our largely untapped youth entrepreneurial talent.<p>
<p class="text-left"><br />The aura and spirit of The Maverick Awards for South African Youth Entrepreneurship 
Excellence is to celebrate the distinctly unique, independent and rare unconventional style of 
thought and action process, possessed only by a select few young people in any society who go 
on to attain phenomenal business success. These young entrepreneurs are prodigies of society 
that must be identified, preciously nurtured and capacitated to create lasting value that will 
continue to live and be enjoyed long after they are their time. The premise of The Maverick 
Awards is based upon the building and bequeathing of youth legacies to posterity.</p>
